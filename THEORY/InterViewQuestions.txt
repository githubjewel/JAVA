/**Abstract class vs Interface**/

  ->Abstract class menas Is-A relationship and interface means CAN-DO/has a relationship.
  
  ->Abstract class may contain constructor but interface has not.

  ->Both abstract class and interface can not be instantiated.

  ->Interface enables polymorphism.A class can implement more than one Interfaces.

  ->To achieve best abstraction(use of abstract method) use interface.

  ->In Java you can only extend one class but implement multiple interface.

  ->Interface are used to represent behavior e.g. Runnable,Clonable,Serializable etc.
    So if we use an abstract class to represent behavior your class can not be 
    Runnable and Clonable at same time. 

  ->To achieve abstraction we can use abstract class or interface but java does not
    support multilevel inheritance so if we use abstract class we can not extend more class.

  ->When we need to add methods in future, then abstract class is better choice. 
    Because adding new methods to an interface causes all implemented classes to
    be changed to implement the new methods.

  ->Use BankAccounts example for Inheritance(Savings account,Personal Accounts).
    All these accounts have same deposite method but different withdraw method
    implementations and they have some common fields i.e. accountNo,Balance etc.
